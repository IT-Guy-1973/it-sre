Mounting iSCSI Luns on Linux Hosts




Things you need to have before setting up the iSCSI mounts.
1. iSCSI startup using the init script or manual startup. You need to edit and configure iSCSI via /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf file
2. Discover targets.
3. Automate target logins for future system reboots.
4. You also need to obtain iSCSI username, password and storage server IP address (target host)


Step 2: Edit the iscsi.conf file

Setup username and password:
node.session.auth.username = My_ISCSI_USR_NAME
node.session.auth.password = MyPassword
discovery.sendtargets.auth.username = My_ISCSI_USR_NAME
discovery.sendtargets.auth.password = MyPassword

Where,
node.session.* is used to set a CHAP username and password for initiator authentication by the target(s).
discovery.sendtargets.* is used to set a discovery session CHAP username and password for the initiator authentication by the target(s)
Make sure iscsi.conf 'node' parameter is set for Automatic
[root@test.com /]# vi /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf
node.startup = automatic

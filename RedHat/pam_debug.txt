    Outline the steps required to enable PAM debugging.
    Description

    User login errors can be investigated by setting up PAM debug and examining the debug log for authentication failures etc.
    Resolution

    1. Add "debug trace" at the end of "auth" pam_vas module entries in /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d/<service specific file>
    e.g. sshd auth sufficient pam_vas3.so create_homedir get_tgt debug trace

    2. Add an entry to /etc/syslog.conf to capture the debug (use tab key below)
    *.debug<tab><tab>/tmp/vas_debug.log

    3. Create the log file.
    # touch /tmp/vas_debug.log

    4. Enable PAM stack debugging (For AIX, Solaris and HP-UX only)
    # touch /etc/pam_debug

    4. Restart syslogd
    # kill -HUP `ps -e | grep -i syslog | awk '{print $1}'`

    5. Please log in as a VAS user you have been experiencing problems with (via ssh, for the example quoted above in step 1) to recreate the error.

    To remove the debugging

    1. Remove the *.debug line you added from your syslog.conf and restart each service again.

    2. Remove the /etc/pam_debug file
    # rm /etc/pam_debug

    3. Remove the debug trace lines added to the PAM files

    4. After you have reviewed or sent the log file to support. If can be safely removed.
    # rm /tmp/vas_debug
    Additional Information
    Entry # 1 Redhat Enterprise Linux 6 now uses rsyslog instead of traditional syslog. To enable debug for RHEL 6 using rsyslog substitute these steps: Step 2. Add an entry to /etc/rsyslog.conf to capture the debug (use tab key below) *.debug<tab><tab>/tmp/vas_debug.log Step 4. Restart rsyslogd # kill -HUP `ps -e | grep -i rsyslog | awk '{print $1}'` Entry # 2 On Linux systems you may find the service specific PAM file doesn't contain any VAS references. In this case, check the file for the presence of a include or service= statement which points to another PAM file. For example, in the below scenario you would need to edit the /etc/pam.d/service-auth file and place debug trace on the VAS lines in that file, rather than the sshd file. # cat /etc/pam.d/sshd #%PAM-1.0 auth include system-auth account required pam_nologin.so account include system-auth password include system-auth session optional pam_keyinit.so force revoke session include system-auth session required pam_loginuid.so Step 2. Add an entry to /etc/rsyslog.conf to capture the debug (use tab key below) *.debug /tmp/vas_debug.log

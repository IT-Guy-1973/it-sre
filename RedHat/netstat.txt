# netstat -apA inet

a - all sockets
p - PID/Program name
"A inet” tells netstat to show only TCP/UDP sockets

Printing routing tables

    # netstat -r
    Kernel IP routing table
    Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
    192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
    link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth0
    default         smoothwall      0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0

Destination
------------
- This table is examined top to bottom, and the first line with a matching destination is then used to determine where to send the packet.
 
- The zero in 192.168.1.0 means “match anything at this position”, so 192.168.1.53 matches, and 192.168.1.254 also matches

- The “link-local” label stands for 169.254.0.0, which is a special range of ip addresses to be used when there is no other way to determine which ip address the computer should have (no DHCP or statically configured address).

- The “default” label stands for 0.0.0.0 and obviously matches any destination; this last line is kind of a catch-all for packets.

Gateway
-------

- Tells the computer where to send a packet that matches the destination of the same line. 
-  An asterisk ( * ) here means “send locally”, because the destination is supposed to be on the same network.

Flags
-----

-  “U” means Up, indicating that this is an active line. “G” means this line uses a Gateway.

irtt
----

- Initial round trip time

Iface
-----

- Which network interface to use to send network packets that match the destination


# netstat -i

Flg
----

- “B” means “broadcast capability”, meaning that this interface can broadcast a packet to everyone on the same subnet.

- “M” means “multicast capability”, meaning that this interface can send packets with multiple destinations. 

- “L” means “loopback interface”, meaning that this is an interface that puts everything sent with it immediately in its own receive queue. 

- “U” and “R” mean “up” and “running”, respectively.

Power of g
===========

The global command :g is very useful. Here are some examples showing the power of :g.

:[range]g/pattern/cmd

Delete all lines matching a pattern.

:g/pattern/d

Delete all lines that do not match a pattern. The commands shown are equivalent (v is "inverse").

:g!/pattern/d
:v/pattern/d

Delete lines that contain a paticular word
==============================================

:g/amos/d

Show hidden characters
========================

: set list
: set nolist

The way to type those pesky special characters in vi (ie ^M) is to use ctrl-v then ctrl-m You then substitute the m for whatever letter you need.

%s/^M//g

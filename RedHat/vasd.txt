To determine if you are joined to an Active Directory domain

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool info domain 

To join Active Directory

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool -u <user> join <domain-name>

Joining the Domain Using VASJOIN Script

# cd /opt/quest/libexec/vas/scripts/
# ./vasjoin.sh


The Authentication Services Configuration File

# cat /etc/opt/quest/vas/vas.conf


Keytab Files 

host principal keys

# /etc/opt/quest/vas/host.keytab

If the host.keytab file is compromised by unauthorized root access on the Unix system, then you can assume
the password for the associated computer object is compromised as well. You can reset the computer object's
password and generate a new keytab file by running
vastool -u <admin> passwd –r –k /etc/opt/quest/vas/host.keytab host/
Another option is to delete the computer object and recreate it by running vastool create host/.




Configuring Name Service Switch (NSS)


# /opt/quest/bin/vastool configure nss

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool unconfigure nss



Using NSCD with Authentication Services


Authentication Services contains similar functionality for its own user and group caches. Therefore, the behavior for
vastool join and vastool configure nss is to modify /etc/nscd.conf to disable nscd caching of
passwd and group data.


Forcing Lowercase Names


To enable this, add the following line to the nss_vas section in vas.conf
lowercase-names = true
To apply the change, you can either restart vasd or flush the cache.


Using VASTOOL to Configure PAM


# /opt/quest/bin/vastool configure pam

To unconfigure:

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool unconfigure pam




To configure sshd to use the Authentication Services PAM module, execute the following command as root:

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool configure pam sshd


To remove the PAM configuration from sshd, execute the following command as root:

# /opt/quest/bin/vastool unconfigure pam sshd


Home Directory Creation

If you need to disable it:

As root, modify the auth line to remove the create_homedir option. For
example, if the auth line looks like:

auth sufficient pam_vas.so create_homedir

the modified entry will look like the following:

auth sufficient pam_vas.so

Enabling Diagnostic Logging - Authntication


adding 'debug trace' to each pam_vas3 line in the appropriate file(s) for the
system



Enabling Diagnostic Logging - Identity

The output includes a line that lists input, result, and time spent in the call. Enable only this line by running
touch /var/opt/quest/vas/.qas_id_call
You can also use the environment variable, QAS_ID_CALL_STDERR to log the result line of the above debug.
This output is useful for profiling the volume/type of calls the Authentication Services identity interface is receiving.
Output is written to the /tmp/qas_module.log file for both options.


Enabling Diagnostic Logging -  vastool 


# /opt/quest/bin/vastool -u administrator -d5 join example.com

Cache Administration


# /opt/quest/bin/vastool flush

Blackout Period

default 10 mins. 

You can adjust the blackout period by changing the update-interval setting in the [vasd] section of
vas.conf.

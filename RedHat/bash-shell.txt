Remove ^M characters in vi

:%s/^M//g

- Where ^M is entered by holding down Ctrl and typing v followed by m, and then releasing Ctrl. 
- This is sometimes abbreviated as ^V^M, but note that you must enter it as described in the previous sentence, rather than typing it out literally.

- This expression will replace all occurrences of ^M with the empty string (i.e. nothing). I use this to get rid of ^M in files copied from Windows to Unix (Solaris, Linux, OSX).

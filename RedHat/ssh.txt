ssh client-side connection options
===================================

  ssh obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following order:

           1.   command-line options
           2.   user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
           3.   system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)


- ssh flags at the command line over-ride the values on file
- $HOME/.ssh/config
- Format of the file:

Host <hostname>
	SSH_OPTION1	custom-value
	SSH_OPTION2	custom-value

HOST <hostname>
   	SSH_OPTION1	custom-value
	SSH_OPTION2	custom-value



- File is interpreted from top to bottom
- File is read to the end and if there are other sections with the same host name it will read those as well
- The first parameter of a option will take precedence over others
- Specific parameters should be at the top and generic ones at the bottom


ssh -p 4567 apollo@example.com

ssh -o "User=apollo: -o "Port=4567" -o "Hostname=examle.com" 

- options can be in any one of the below wasy
 
port 4567
port=4567

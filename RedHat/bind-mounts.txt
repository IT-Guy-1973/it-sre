- Bind mounts are quite simple. Instead of mounting a device (with a file system) on a particular path you are mounting one path into another path.

- /var running out of space

mv /var/log /opt/var_log
mkdir /var/log
mount -o bind /opt/var_log /var/log
# mount | grep var
/opt/var_log on /var/log type none (rw,bind)

- If you want this to persist across reboots, you’ll just need to update your /etc/fstab with the bind mount as well.

- My backups usually do NOT cross mount points, so I can backup root without everything else. If “find” treats it as a mount point, it won’t be crossed by most backup programs or scripts. But I see your point if the mount-directory itself is specified to a backup program that can’t be told to follow symbolic links.

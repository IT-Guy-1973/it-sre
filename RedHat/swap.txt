Creating an LVM2 Logical Volume for Swap

Create the LVM2 logical volume of size 2 GB:

# lvcreate VolGroup00 -n LogVol02 -L 2G

Format the new swap space:

# mkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02

Add the following entry to the /etc/fstab file:

/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02   swap     swap    defaults     0 0

Regenerate mount units so that your system registers the new configuration:

# systemctl daemon-reload

Activate swap on the logical volume:

# swapon -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol02

To test if the swap logical volume was successfully created and activated, inspect active swap space:

$ cat /proc/swaps
$ free -h


Extending Swap on an LVM2 Logical Volume

Disable swapping for the associated logical volume:

# swapoff -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01

Resize the LVM2 logical volume by 2 GB:

# lvresize /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01 -L +2G

Format the new swap space:

# mkswap /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01

Enable the extended logical volume:

# swapon -v /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol01

To test if the swap logical volume was successfully extended and activated, inspect active swap space:


$ cat /proc/swaps
$ free -h


Add a Swap File

Determine the size of the new swap file in megabytes and multiply by 1024 to determine the number of blocks. For example, the block size of a 64 MB swap file is 65536.

Create an empty file:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536

Replace count with the value equal to the desired block size.

Set up the swap file with the command:

# mkswap /swapfile

Change the security of the swap file so it is not world readable.

# chmod 0600 /swapfile

To enable the swap file at boot time, edit /etc/fstab as root to include the following entry:

/swapfile          swap            swap    defaults        0 0

The next time the system boots, it activates the new swap file.

Regenerate mount units so that your system registers the new /etc/fstab configuration:

# systemctl daemon-reload

To activate the swap file immediately:

# swapon /swapfile

To test if the new swap file was successfully created and activated, inspect active swap space:

$ cat /proc/swaps
$ free -h

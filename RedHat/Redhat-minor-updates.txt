How to restrict yum to install or upgrade a package to a fixed specific package version?
=========================================================================================

1. Install package named yum-plugin-versionlock (called yum-versionlock in RHEL 5).

# yum install yum-plugin-versionlock

The /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list will be created on the system.

2. To install or lock the version of the gcc package, add that package name to the /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list file by running:

# yum versionlock gcc-*

(Alternatively, you can edit the filelist, /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/versionlock.list, directly.)

 - The above configuration will not allow to upgrade the gcc package to version greater than what was installed at the time 
the locking was performed.

- Yum will attempt to update all packages, while excluding the packages listed in the versionlock file.

# yum versionlock list

# yum versionlock clear



How do I install a specific kernel version?
===============================================

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/134403


# yum install kernel-<version>-<revision>-<arch>


Example:

# yum install kernel-2.6.18-194.el5


How do I exclude kernel or other packages from getting updated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux while updating system via yum?
==========================================================================================================================

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/10185

Temporary solution via Command line:

# yum update --exclude=PACKAGENAME 

Example:

# yum update --exclude=kernel*


To make permanent changes, edit the /etc/yum.conf file and following entries to it:

[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever
keepcache=0
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log
exclude=kernel* redhat-release*      <-----

NOTE: If there are multiple package to be excluded then separate them using a single space or comma. 
Also, do not add multiple exclude= lines in the configuration file because yum only considers the last exclude entry.

To exclude 32 bit packages edit /etc/yum.conf file.

exclude=*.i?86 *.i686

There are two main clocks in a Linux system



https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2874


1. The hardware clock

	- runs independently of any control program running in the CPU and even when the machine is powered off
	- hardware clock, the real time clock, the RTC, the BIOS clock, or the CMOS clock.
	- The Hardware Clock’s basic purpose in the operating system is to keep time when the system is not running.

2. The System Time

	- This is the time kept by a clock inside the Linux kernel and driven by a timer source

	suse-smt:~ #  cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
tsc



	- The System Time is initialised to the time from the Hardware Clock when the system starts up through hwclock command.

	- If the timezone is correct but the date and/or time needs updating, the following command will update the date and time

		# date 120711082006
			Thu Dec 7 11:08:00 IST 2006



	- The date command only change the system time, if you want to push the date and time into the hardware clock, you need run hwclock manually:

		# hwclock --utc --systohc

--systohc will set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time. --utc Hardware Clock will be in coordination with Universal Time Clock.

Refer to man hwclock for more information.


		suse-smt:~ # hwclock --show

How to change the system time zone from command line in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier


Redhat 6 and lower
==================

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7089

1. Find the desired time zone file in the /usr/share/zoneinfo/ directory, for example: "America/New_York", be sure the file /etc/localtime is not a symbolic link or the change will not work:

# file /etc/localtime 
/etc/localtime: symbolic link to `/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Mountain'
# unlink /etc/localtime

2. Edit /etc/sysconfig/clock and change the ZONE= declaration in to ensure the time zone is read properly by the tzdata-update command each time the tzdata package gets updated (or when system-config-date is run), e.g.:


ZONE="America/New_York"

3. And finally, run tzdata-update which will reconfigure your system time zone, write the new /etc/localtime and notify the operating system that there was a time zone change. There's no need to reboot.

# tzdata-update

4. Run the date command to ensure it reports the expected time and date.


Rhel7 and Rhel8
==================

1. Find the desired time zone with the below command or we can use the command "tzselect" to find the desired time zone..Let's make "Asia/Shanghai" as an example.


# timedatectl list-timezones


2. Change the time zone.


# timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Shanghai


3. Verify the status of time zone.

# timedatectl status

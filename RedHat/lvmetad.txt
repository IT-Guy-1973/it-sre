When set to 1 and when lvmetad is running (it is not auto-started), the volume group metadata and PV state flags are obtained from the lvmetad instance and no scanning is done
by the individual commands. In a setup with lvmetad, lvmetad udev rules must be set up for LVM to work correctly. Without proper udev rules, all changes in block device 
configuration will be ignored until a manual pvscan --cache is performed.

LVM can optionally use a central metadata cache, implemented through a daemon (lvmetad) and a udev rule. The metadata daemon has two main purposes: it improves performance of LVM commands and it allows udev to automatically activate logical volumes or entire volume groups as they become available to the system.

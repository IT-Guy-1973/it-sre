- As of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0, it is possible to make changes to the SCSI I/O subsystem without rebooting

Remove a multipath device
==========================

1. Remove all processes holding the device

# unmount /FS1
# kpartx -d mpatha
# vgchange -an datavg
# lvchange -an lvname
# lvs -o +devices 
# dmsetup remove -f
# dmsetup clear

2. Once all the processes have been removed:

# multipath -f mpatha

3. Flush pending IO to the device ( Raw devices) 

# blockdev --flushbufs /dev/sda
# blockdev --flushbufs /dev/sdb


4. Remove any reference to the device's path-based name.

5. Remove each path to the device.

# echo 1 >  /sys/block/device-name/device/delete

OR

# echo 1 >  /sys/class/scsi_device/h:c:t:l/device/delete 

h: HBA
c: Channel
t: SCSI target
l: LUN


# echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg-name/device/delete


sg: SCSI Generic 
lsscsi -g <--- Will show the scsi generic name


# echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_tape/tape-name/device/delete  <--- Tape device


Adding Storage Devices
=======================

# echo "c t l" >  /sys/class/scsi_host/hostH/scan


Map HCTL to sd device

$ /usr/bin/lsscsi -g

Map sd to HTCL


$ ls -l /sys/block/sdb/device/scsi_device/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x. 3 root root 0 Jul 16 11:14 4:0:0:0

-OR-

$ /usr/bin/sg_map -x
/dev/sg0  3 0 0 0  5  /dev/scd0
/dev/sg1  3 0 1 0  0  /dev/sda
/dev/sg2  4 0 0 0  0  /dev/sdb



sg_luns /dev/sdh  <---- Map 

 The sg_luns command sends a scsi REPORT LUNS command to the device, although the target is the one that answers the
command, not the lun itself.

sg_inq /dev/sdh  <----- SCSI Inquiry

Peripheral Qualifier flag 

0: create a scsi device and try and attach an appropriate upper layer driver (sd, st, sr) to it if possible.
1: create a scsi device, but don't attach an upper layer driver. The device is exposed through sg so apps can communicate with it and possibly configure it to make the PQ 0.
3: There is no device here. The lun is ignored and no scsi device is created.


Remove a disk
=============

$ echo "scsi remove-single-device h c t l" > /proc/scsi/scsi

But I don't know the hctl scsi address associated with disk sdcc, then I can use the sg_map command to find that information:

$ sg_map -x | grep sdcc
/dev/sg62  4 0 1 20  0  /dev/sdcc
$ echo "scsi remove-single-device 4 0 1 20" > /proc/scsi/scsi
In the above example, the device could also have been deleted via:

echo 1 > /sys/block/sdcc/device/delete, or
echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/4:0:1:20/device/delete, or
echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi-generic/sg62/device/delete
